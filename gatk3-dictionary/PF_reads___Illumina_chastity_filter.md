## PF reads / Illumina chastity filter

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>Illumina sequencers perform an internal quality filtering procedure called <strong>chastity filter</strong>, and reads that pass this filter are called <strong>PF</strong> for <strong>pass-filter</strong>. According to Illumina, <strong>chastity</strong> is defined as the ratio of the brightest base intensity divided by the sum of the brightest and second brightest base intensities. Clusters of reads pass the filter if no more than 1 base call has a chastity value below 0.6 in the first 25 cycles. This filtration process removes the least reliable clusters from the image analysis results.</p>
