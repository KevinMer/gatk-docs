## Biallelic vs Multiallelic sites

By KateN

<p>A <strong>biallelic</strong> site is a specific locus in a genome that contains two observed alleles, counting the reference as one, and therefore allowing for one variant allele. In practical terms, this is what you would call a site where, across multiple samples in a cohort, you have evidence for a single non-reference allele. Shown below is a toy example in which the consensus sequence for samples 1-3 have a <em>deletion</em> at position 7. Sample 4 matches the reference. This is considered a biallelic site because there are only two possible alleles-- a deletion, or the reference allele <code class="code codeInline" spellcheck="false">G</code>.</p>

<pre class="code codeBlock" spellcheck="false">           1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Reference: A T A T A T G C G
Sample 1 : A T A T A T - C G
Sample 2 : A T A T A T - C G
Sample 3 : A T A T A T - C G
Sample 4 : A T A T A T G C G

This is what you would call a site where, across multiple samples in a cohort, you see evidence for two or more non-reference alleles. Show below is a toy example in which the consensus sequences for samples 1-3 have a <em>deletion</em> or a <em>SNP</em> at the 7th position. Sample 4 matches the reference. This is considered a multiallelic site because there are four possible alleles-- a deletion, the reference allele <code class="code codeInline" spellcheck="false">G</code>, a <code class="code codeInline" spellcheck="false">C</code> (SNP), or a <code class="code codeInline" spellcheck="false">T</code> (SNP). True multiallelic sites are not observed very frequently unless you look at very large cohorts, so they are often taken as a sign of a noisy region where artifacts are likely.</p>
