<hr></hr><h1>Running the Indel Realigner only at known sites</h1>

<p>While we advocate for using the Indel Realigner over an aggregated bam using the full Smith-Waterman alignment algorithm, it will work for just a single lane of sequencing data when run in -knownsOnly mode.  Novel sites obviously won't be cleaned up, but the majority of a single individual's short indels will already have been seen in dbSNP and/or 1000 Genomes.  One would employ the known-only/lane-level realignment strategy in a large-scale project (e.g. 1000 Genomes) where computation time is severely constrained and limited.  We modify the example arguments from above to reflect the command-lines necessary for known-only/lane-level cleaning.
</p>

<p>The RealignerTargetCreator step would need to be done just once for a single set of indels; so as long as the set of known indels doesn't change, the output.intervals file from below would never need to be recalculated.

<p>The IndelRealigner step needs to be run on every bam file.
