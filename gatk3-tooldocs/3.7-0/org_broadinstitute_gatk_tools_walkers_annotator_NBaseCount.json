The presence of many Ns at the same site lowers our confidence in any calls made there, because it suggests that there was some kind of technical difficulty that interfered with the sequencing process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eNote\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eIn GATK versions 3.2 and earlier, this annotation only counted N bases from reads generated with SOLiD technology.
