You have to recalculate\n them after combining. The reason for not calculating it is because this function is intended for combining a\n series of recalibration reports, and it only makes sense to calculate the empirical qualities and quantized\n qualities after all the recalibration reports have been combined. This is done to make the tool faster.\n \u003c/li\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eThe reported empirical quality is recalculated (because it is so simple to do).\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003c/ul\u003e",
