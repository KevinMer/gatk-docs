It performs the same basic function as the regular\n MappingQualityFilter, but it is used at specific points in the operation of HC where it is helpful\n to be able to apply a different quality threshold from the general case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eUsage example\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n \u003ch4\u003eSet the HC-specific mapping quality filter to filter out reads with MAPQ \u003c 10\u003c/h4\u003e\n \u003cpre\u003e\n     java -jar GenomeAnalysisTk.jar \\\n         -T HaplotypeCaller \\\n         -R reference.fasta \\\n         -I input.bam \\\n         -o output.vcf \\\n         -mmq 10\n \u003c/pre\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eNote that the HCMappingQuality filter itself does not need to be specified in the command line because it is set\n automatically for HaplotypeCaller.\u003c/p\u003e",
