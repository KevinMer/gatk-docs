  "description": "\n\n \u003cp\u003e\n The local realignment process is designed to consume one or more BAM files and to locally realign reads such that the number of mismatching bases\n is minimized across all the reads. In general, a large percent of regions requiring local realignment are due to the presence of an insertion\n or deletion (indels) in the individual\u0027s genome with respect to the reference genome.  Such alignment artifacts result in many bases mismatching\n the reference near the misalignment, which are easily mistaken as SNPs.  Moreover, since read mapping algorithms operate on each read independently,\n it is impossible to place reads on the reference genome such that mismatches are minimized across all reads.  Consequently, even when some reads are\n correctly mapped with indels, reads covering the indel near just the start or end of the read are often incorrectly mapped with respect the true indel,\n also requiring realignment.  Local realignment serves to transform regions with misalignments due to indels into clean reads containing a consensus\n indel suitable for standard variant discovery approaches.\n \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eNote that indel realignment is no longer necessary for variant discovery if you plan to use a variant caller that performs a haplotype assembly\n step, such as HaplotypeCaller or MuTect2. However it is still required when using legacy callers such as UnifiedGenotyper or the original MuTect.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n     \u003cp\u003eThere are 2 steps to the realignment process:\u003c/p\u003e\n     \u003col\u003e\n     \u003cli\u003eDetermining (small) suspicious intervals which are likely in need of realignment (RealignerTargetCreator)\u003c/li\u003e\n     \u003cli\u003eRunning the realigner over those intervals (see the IndelRealigner tool)\u003c/li\u003e\n     \u003c/ol\u003e\n     \u003cp\u003e\n \u003cp\u003e\n     For more details, see \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/article?id\u003d38\"\u003ethe indel realignment method documentation\u003c/a\u003e.\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eInputs\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cp\u003e\n One or more aligned BAM files and optionally, one or more lists of known indels.\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eOutput\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cp\u003e\n A list of target intervals to pass to the IndelRealigner.\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eUsage example\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cpre\u003e\n java -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar \\\n   -T RealignerTargetCreator \\\n   -R reference.fasta \\\n   -I input.bam \\\n   --known indels.vcf \\\n   -o forIndelRealigner.intervals\n \u003c/pre\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eNotes\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cul\u003e\n     \u003cli\u003eThe input BAM(s), reference, and known indel file(s) should be the same ones to be used for the IndelRealigner step.\u003c/li\u003e\n     \u003cli\u003eWhen multiple potential indels are found by the tool in the same general region, the tool will choose the most likely\n          one for realignment to the exclusion of the others.
