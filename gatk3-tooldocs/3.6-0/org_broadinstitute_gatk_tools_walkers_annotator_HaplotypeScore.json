If there is evidence for more\n than 2 segregating haplotypes, the read data should be considered suspect and the evidence artifactual. Higher scores are indicative of regions with bad alignments, typically leading to artifactual SNP and indel calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eCaveats\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eHaplotypeCaller does not output this annotation because it already evaluates haplotype segregation internally.
