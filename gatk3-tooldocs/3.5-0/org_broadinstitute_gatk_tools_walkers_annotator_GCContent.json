Some sequencing technologies have trouble with high GC content because of the stronger bonds of G-C nucleotide pairs, so high GC values tend to be associated with low coverage depth and lower confidence calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eCaveat\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eThe window size used to calculate the GC content around the site is determined by the tool used for annotation (UnifiedGenotyper, HaplotypeCaller or VariantAnnotator).
