  "description": "\n\n \u003cp\u003eRepetitive sequences such as homopolymers are difficult to map to the reference because they are associated with multiple alignment possibilities. The proximity of a long homopolymer to your variant site increases the chance that reads were mapped incorrectly in the surrounding region and lowers confidence in the call. If there is a homopolymer on either side of a site, this annotation outputs the length of its largest run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eCaveats\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cul\u003e\n     \u003cli\u003eThis can only be computed for bi-allelic sites.\u003c/li\u003e\n     \u003cli\u003eThe calculation only looks at direct runs of the alternate allele adjacent to this position, which is not a very accurate method.\u003c/li\u003e\n     \u003cli\u003eThis is an experimental annotation. As such, it is unsupported; we do not make any guarantees that it will work properly, and you use it at your own risk.\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003c/ul\u003e",
