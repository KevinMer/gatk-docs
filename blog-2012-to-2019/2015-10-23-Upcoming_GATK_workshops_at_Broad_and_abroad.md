## Upcoming GATK workshops at Broad and abroad

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>Yay, it's workshop planning season again!</p>

<h3>USA: Cambridge, MA - November 18-19, 2015</h3>

<p>Another local BroadE workshop at the Broad Institute for our Boston Metro Area peeps (and anyone who cares to travel to us on short notice). This will be the last workshop of 2015 and the first to cover the upcoming GATK version 3.5 -- which we really have to release soon now! As usual, the topic will be GATK Best Practices, with all the latest updates, some fresh material including two somatic variant discovery talks, and two completely revamped hands-on tutorial sessions. Registration will open on Monday, October 26 and stay open for one week. We'll post a link to the registration site when it goes live.</p>

<p>More below the fold: our preliminary workshop lineup for the 2016 Winter &amp; Spring season.</p>

<hr></hr><p>Specific details per workshop to be announced as they become available. Dates are given as an estimate pending confirmation (some workshop plans are still subject to changes by the organizing hosts).</p>

<h3>Australia: Sydney and Melbourne - February 1-5, 2016</h3>

<p>2x Two times two-day Best Practices workshops back to back in Sydney and Melbourne. Pick your city, Aussies. Kiwis welcome, although we'd prefer if you invited us over to you at some point as well <img class="emoji" src="https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)" alt=";)" height="20"></img></p>

<h3>USA West Coast: LA - March 2-4, 2016</h3>

<p>Three-day workshop with morning talks and afternoon hands-on tutorials at UCLA. We're looking forward to visiting the Walk of Fame.</p>

<h3>UK: Oxford and possibly Edinburgh - April 14-19, 2016</h3>

<p>2x Two-day Best Practices workshops back to back. Pick one.</p>

<p>If you're at U of Edinburgh, there's currently a survey going around to gauge interest in doing another workshop (we did one earlier this year). Find it and let them know you want it to happen.</p>

<p>Oxford, we're definitely coming to you.</p>

<h3>UK and Finland: Cambridge and Helsinki (?) - June 13-17, 2016</h3>

<p>2x Two-day Best Practices workshops back to back. Pick one.</p>

<p>Perhaps not the most obvious pairing, but there we go. Literally. We're going there.</p>

<p>And yes, that's the <em>original</em> Cambridge.</p>

<h3>[Your country and institution here]</h3>

<p>In case you're wondering: we're open for invitations by academic and non-profit organizations for any month of 2016 not already booked. We don't charge for giving the workshops; we just ask for the inviting host to cover our travel and living costs.</p>

<p>Note: if you're a commercial organization interested in on-site training opportunities, let us know by email at softwarelicensing@broadinstitute.org and our business office will be in touch to discuss options.</p>
