## Consolidation of Ask the Team / Ask the Community categories

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>We've realized that having separate Team / Community Q&amp;A sections is confusing and unnecessary, so we are going to merge the two. From now on there will only be one Q&amp;A section (Ask the Team). We invite you to ask any questions related to the GATK and its application in that category. We welcome answers and comments from everyone in the community in these discussions; if you know something, say something! And of course you are also always welcome to comment on tool and method documentation articles.</p>
