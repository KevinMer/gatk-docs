## Blame the weather

<p>We're admittedly a little late bringing you the details of the GATK 3.0 features; our excuse is entirely meteorological. To whit, here is the view from GATK Support &amp; Outreach HQ earlier this afternoon:</p>

<p>And the GATKmobile:</p>

<p>The lovely, very festive coating of crystalline H20 you see in these images unfortunately entails a significant amount of time spent shoveling, which equates to time not spent writing about the wondrous new features of the upcoming GATK release.</p>

<p>We'll do our best to catch up promptly, if the weather gods allow it.</p>
