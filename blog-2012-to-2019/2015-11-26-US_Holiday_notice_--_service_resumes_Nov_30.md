## US Holiday notice -- service resumes Nov 30

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>Please be advised that the forum will be unattended for the duration of the Thanksgiving holiday, 26-29 Nov. During that time, we'll only answer questions if we need an excuse to escape from in-laws or screaming babies (which is worse is a matter of some debate).</p>

<p>Regular service will resume Monday 30 Nov.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving message below the fold.</p>

<hr></hr><p>To our US peeps: happy holiday and stay safe; don't drink and drive, and if you go shopping on Friday, don't get trampled.</p>
