## Calling all GATK-savvy developers: we're hiring!

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>We're looking for a developer (software engineer or equivalent) to join our team on a part-time basis as a software engineering consultant.</p>

<p>The mission is to take on tasks that are non-critical but still important, such as fixing bugs and implementing minor feature requests, usability improvements and so on in the GATK codebase. The idea is to take much of the maintenance burden off of the core development team so they can focus on developing new tools and methods.</p>

<p>We already have one person employed in this capacity, and it's working out very well. However there is quite a bit more to do than he can find time for, and therefore we'd like to hire a second consultant to pick up the extra work in parallel. (We were hoping to just clone him but ran into some difficulties getting IRB approval.)</p>

<p>This position does not require expert knowledge of GATK, but familiarity with the GATK tools is a big plus. The main language is Java, with a small side of R and Scala. We also have a growing corpus of C++ code that is not yet in the scope of this position, but may move into scope some months down the line.</p>

<p>Note that this opportunity is amenable to remote work so you don't need to be local to the Boston area, but it is limited to US residents with valid work authorization (no H1B sponsorship possible, sorry).</p>

<p>Drop us a line in the comments below or private-message me (<a href="https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/profile/Geraldine_VdAuwera%29" rel="nofollow">@Geraldine_VdAuwera)</a> to discuss details.</p>
