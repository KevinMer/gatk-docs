## The new Best Practices section is online!

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>We're very pleased to announce that we have finally finished our big rewrite of the Best Practices documentation. We hope that the new format, which you can find <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/best-practices">here</a>, will prove more user-friendly, searchable and overall more helpful than the previous version.</p>

<p>We have a few more improvements in mind (e.g. a clickable image map of the workflow) and there may be a few bugs here and there to iron out. So please feel free to comment on this announcement and give us feedback, whether flattering or critical, so we can improve it to help you as much as possible.</p>
