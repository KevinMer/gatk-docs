## GATK in the UK : April 20-24 workshops

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>We're going to be doing two back-to-back workshops in Edinburgh and Cambridge (the original, accept no substitutes) later this Spring, on April 20-21 and 23-24 respectively. The workshop program for both will be our typical one-day Best Practices lectures marathon followed by a half-day of lectures on supplemental topics (QC, non-humans, etc) and a half-day hands-on sessions for beginners to get their hands dirty with some real data.</p>

<p>These workshops are organized locally by the inviting institutions, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://genomics.ed.ac.uk/gatk-best-practices-variant-discovery">University of Edinburgh</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://training.csx.cam.ac.uk/event/1380452">University of Cambridge</a>, so please see the respective links for registration information.</p>

<p>Cheers to our hosts and we hope to see lots of you there!</p>
