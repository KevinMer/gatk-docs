## Genome Science UK 2014: my presentation slides and a few impressions

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>The slides from the talk I gave at the Genome Science UK conference (Oxford, Sept 2) are now available <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/events?id=4570">here</a>.</p>

<p>A few impressions below the fold.</p>

<hr></hr><p>As always it was fun meeting plenty of GATK users and other researchers in general, and very exciting to get to spread the word about our new workflow and the HaplotypeCaller's capabilities. Special thanks to Mick Watson from Edinburgh Genomics for inviting me, and his team for making me feel super welcome.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed getting to see quite a few microbial genomics talks, since I am originally a microbiologist by training. Too bad I had to miss the plant/forestry B session, as I'm very curious about the crazy-ploidy aspects of plant genomics, but that's the curse of parallel sessions I suppose. Very interesting conference overall for sure, and a nice group size -- lively but not overwhelming (I dislike mega-cons like ASHG). Though maybe next time Nick Loman should get the main lecture theater for his MinION talk instead of the little basement room -- and someone should make sure the wifi network can handle dozens of data-crazed scientists trying to download his MinION datasets at the same time.</p>

<p>A final note on the live-tweeting, i.e. people in the audience tweeting snippets during the talk. I was aware of this as a trend, and in fact I've followed tweet-streams of other people's talks, but had never experienced it myself as a speaker. It's a bit nerve-inducing but very interesting as an insight into what (at least some of) the audience reacted most strongly to and took away from the talk. It also stimulated some interesting follow-up exchanges, so I'll tentatively classify it as a Good Thing for now.</p>
