## Spam issues on the forum

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>You may have noticed that we're currently experiencing a surge in spamming on the forum. We're working with our host, Vanilla, to tighten our spam blockers and flood control measures. As part of that we're going to increase the mandatory delay between postings, so you may find yourself unable to post several times in a row. If that happens, you'll need to wait a few minutes and try again. This should help cut down the spam by reducing how quickly spammers can post, which in turn will give us time to ban them, and generally make it less worthwhile for them to attack us.</p>

<p>You may also find yourself unable to post if you never got around to confirming the email you signed up with. Due to an oversight, we weren't requiring email confirmation, which is one of the ways spammers can gain advantage over our controls. So we've closed that hole, but it does mean that if you haven't done it yet, you will now need to go back and confirm your email with the forum. If you can't find the original forum email, click <a rel="nofollow" href="https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/entry/emailconfirmrequest">here</a> to get a new confirmation request emailed to you.</p>

<p>I'm very sorry for the inconvenience this represents for all of you legitimate forum denizens, and I hope we can get past this quickly.</p>
