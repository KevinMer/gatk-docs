## Holiday Notice: Forum unattended during winter break until 1/4/16

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>It's unnaturally not-cold outside and ducks are frolicking on the Charles river instead of heading South, but despite that, I'm told it's time to shut down the shop and take a break for the holidays.</p>

<p>The Broad Institute mothership will be closed from tomorrow Wednesday 12/24 and reopen Monday 1/4 of the new year (that would be 2016). Accordingly, we GATK support elves will enjoy some rest and relaxation, and we hope that you will do the same (as applicable to your local culture, calendar and more or less amenable PIs).</p>

<p>In the meantime, be aware that the forum will be mostly unattended; there is no guarantee that any questions will be answered until January 4th. We will be back with great enthusiasm, many answers and possibly (definitely!) some exciting new announcements at the start of the new year.</p>

<p>Should you wish to send us a holiday card (aka the nicest possible way to make a feature request) please write:</p>

<p>If you include a return address we'd be happy to return the courtesy.</p>

<p>Happy holidays to all!</p>
