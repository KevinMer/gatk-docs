<hr></hr><p>This workshop will focus on the core steps involved in calling variants with the Broad’s Genome Analysis Toolkit, using the “Best Practices” developed by the GATK team. The GATK development team and invited guests will give talks explaining the rationale, theory and real-life applications of the Best Practices. You will learn why each step is essential to the calling process, what are the key operations performed on the data at each step, and how to use the GATK tools to get the most accurate and reliable results out of your dataset.</p>

<p>An optional hands-on session will be available to select participants. In this session, the GATK team will help beginners work through interactive exercises and tutorials to learn how to use GATK and apply the Best Practices to real data.</p>

<p>Workshop attendees will gain broad insight into the rationale of the GATK Best Practices for variant discovery, as well as a solid understanding of how individual GATK tools work and how to apply them in practice. Novices to the GATK will come out of the workshop knowing enough to identify which questions they can use address using GATK tools, how to get started on designing their experiment and analytical workflow, and how to run the tools on their own computer. Existing GATK users will come out with a deeper understanding of how the GATK works under the hood and how to improve their results further, especially as regards the latest innovations.</p>
