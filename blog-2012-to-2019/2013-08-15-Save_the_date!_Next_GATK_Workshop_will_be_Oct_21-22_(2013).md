## Save the date! Next GATK Workshop will be Oct 21-22 (2013)

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>We're planning the next GATK workshop to fall right before the ASHG conference in Boston, so that ASHG attendees traveling in from out of town can kill two birds with one stone.</p>

<p>Program details will follow, but roughly, we'll have one full day of talks devoted to the Best Practices workflow (Monday 21st) and one morning of talks devoted to pipelining analyses with Queue (Tuesday 22nd), plus an optional hands-on session on Tuesday afternoon. Registration for the talk sessions will be open to all, but the hands-on session will be reserved for Broadies.</p>

<p>All workshop materials will be posted online as usual of course.</p>
