## Job opportunity for a computational biologist

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>Yep, we're hiring again; we need even more compbios!</p>

<p>Do you dream of working on challenging problems, in a stimulating environment with plentiful resources? Or do you simply love the GATK and wish you could spend every waking moment playing with it? Good news! We have a position open for a computational biologist to join our team. You can find out more about us on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/about/who-we-are">this page</a>. The job itself? In a nutshell, help develop and apply methods in NGS to medical genetics projects. You can find more details in the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/careers/job-openings/job-openings-0">Broad Career Center</a> -- look for Requisition Number #1107.</p>

<p>If you're interested (and who wouldn't be?) please message <a href="https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/profile/rpoplin" rel="nofollow">@rpoplin</a> directly. That's Ryan Poplin, now leader of the Computational Methods Development group since Eric Banks became big chief of GSA last week.</p>

<p>We are of course happy to answer questions here in this thread about what it's like to work in the GSA group (awesome!) and how interesting it is to work on the bleeding edge of genome research (amazing!). Feel free to private-message us about it if you don't want your supervisor to know that you're thinking of jumping ship ;-)</p>
