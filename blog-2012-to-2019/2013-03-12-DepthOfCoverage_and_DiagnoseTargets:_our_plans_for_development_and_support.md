## DepthOfCoverage and DiagnoseTargets: our plans for development and support

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>We have decided to continue providing and supporting DepthOfCoverage and DiagnoseTargets for the foreseeable future. Going forward, we'll try to integrate them and develop their features to address the main needs of the community. To this end we welcome your continuing feedback, so please feel free to contribute comments and ideas in this thread.</p>

<p>To all who took the time to tell us what you find useful about DoC and DT (and what you wish it could do), a big thank you! This is always very useful to us because it helps us identify which features are most valuable to our users.</p>
