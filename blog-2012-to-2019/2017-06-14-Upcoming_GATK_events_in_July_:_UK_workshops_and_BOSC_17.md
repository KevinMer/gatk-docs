## Upcoming GATK events in July : UK workshops and BOSC 17

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>We've been getting so caught up in the excitement of the imminent beta release of GATK4 (possibly later this week!), we forgot to announce upcoming workshops! And two of them are coming up fast, in just a month from now. Specifically, we'll be in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://training.csx.cam.ac.uk/bioinformatics/event/2047357">Cambridge, UK, July 12-14</a> and then in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://genomics.ed.ac.uk/services/gatk-best-practices-variant-discovery">Edinburgh, UK, July 17-19</a>. There's still time to register for both but the hands-on sessions have limited space, so don't wait around!</p>

<p>GATK is also going to be making a brief appearance at BOSC '17 in Prague, CZ, July 21-22. Our team member Kate Voss will give a lightning talk and present a poster about our genomics pipelining stack that is composed of GATK4+WDL+Cromwell. I'm frankly delighted that our abstract was accepted as a late-breaking submission; it's a pleasure to kick off the new open-source era of GATK at the most open-sourcey meeting of the year!</p>

<p>Going forward, be sure to check out the new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/events">Events calendar feature</a> we just now added to the website to help you keep track of events more systematically.</p>
