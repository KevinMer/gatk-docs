## What is most important for a Q&amp;A session?

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>We're planning to organize online live Q&amp;A sessions in which you will be able to submit questions (within a predefined topic, eg. "base recalibration" or "variant calling") for the developers to answer. To help us choose between several software options, we would like to know which of the following options would be the most valuable to you (please choose one):</p>

<ol><li><p>Ability to vote for questions, so that the most popular questions get answered (we expect a lot of questions and will probably not have time to answer all of them).</p></li>
<li><p>Ability to chat directly with us if your question is picked, so that if our answer doesn't really answer your question you can clarify or ask for more details.</p></li>
</ol><p>Feel free to tell us in the comments what other features would be useful.</p>
