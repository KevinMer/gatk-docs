  <p class="blockquote-line">The Center for Genetics and Complex Traits (CGACT) and the Institute for Biomedical Informatics (IBI) of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine announce a Workshop on Variants Discovery in Next Generation Sequence Data on September 18 and 19, 2014.</p>
  
  <p class="blockquote-line">This workshop will focus on the core steps involved in calling variants with the Broad Institute¹s Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), using the "Best Practices" developed by the GATK team, and will be presented by Dr. Geraldine Van der Auwera of the Broad Institute and other instructors from the GATK team. Participants will learn why each step is essential to the calling process, what are the key operations performed on the data at each step, and how to use the GATK tools to get the most accurate and reliable results out of their dataset. </p>
  
  <p class="blockquote-line">The workshop will take place over two consecutive days (September 18 and 19, 2014). In the morning lecture sessions, attendees will learn the rationale, theory, and real-life applications of GATK Best Practices for variant discovery in high-throughput DNA sequencing data, including recommendations for additional experimental designs and datatypes such as RNAseq. In the afternoon hands-on sessions, attendees will learn to interact with the GATK tools and apply them effectively through interactive exercises and tutorials.</p>
  
  <p class="blockquote-line">The morning lecture sessions will take place on Thursday, September 18, from 9:00 am to 12:30 pm, and Friday, September 19, from 9:00 am to 11:30 am, in the Dunlop Auditorium of Stemmler Hall, University of Pennsylvania, 3450 Hamilton Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104. Both morning sessions are open to all participants and registration is not required.</p>
  
  <p class="blockquote-line">The afternoon hands-on sessions will take place on Thursday, September 18, from 2:00 pm to 5:30 pm, and Friday, September 19, from 1:00 pm to 4:30 pm. The September 18 hands-on session is aimed mainly at beginners (though familiarity with the command line environment is expected). The September 19 hands-on session is aimed at more advanced users who are already familiar with the basic GATK functions. Attendance to the hands-on sessions is limited to 20 participants each day, and precedence will be given to members of the University of Pennsylvania or its affiliated hospitals and research institutes (HUP, CHOP, Monell, Wistar, etc.).</p>
  
  <p class="blockquote-line">Registration for the hands-on sessions is mandatory and open through Friday, August 29th at <a href="http://ibi.upenn.edu/?p=996" rel="nofollow">http://ibi.upenn.edu/?p=996</a>. </p>
