## Save the date: online event January 9 for the GATK 4.0 release

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>To celebrate the release of GATK 4.0, a project more than two years in the making, we're planning a Facebook Live event during which we'll livestream a series of presentations and discussion panels. These will feature GATK developers as well as special guests who will talk about their experience either using GATK in their research or contributing to its development. There will be ample opportunity to ask questions in the event discussion thread and have them answered live by the presenters and panelists.</p>

<p>The event will take place from 2 PM to 4 PM Eastern Time, and the livestream video will be accessible to all on the Broad Institute's Facebook page. Exact details including URL and guest lineup will be posted on this blog the first week of January.</p>

<p>We're hoping you will join us online for this event!</p>
