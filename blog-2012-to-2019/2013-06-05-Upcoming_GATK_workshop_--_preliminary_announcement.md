## Upcoming GATK workshop -- preliminary announcement

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>We are organizing a user workshop on GATK Best Practices, which will take place July 9-10 at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, MA, USA.</p>

<p>The workshop will take the same format as last time, with lectures in the morning and hands-on tutorials in the afternoon on both days.</p>

<p>It will be free and open to all comers, but space at the hands-on tutorials will be limited, so be on the lookout for our announcement when registration opens. We will announce it here on the forum and by Twitter (follow us at <a href="https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/profile/gatk_dev%29" rel="nofollow">@gatk_dev)</a>.</p>

<p>We regret that we are not able to offer any financial assistance for travel or lodging. However all the workshop materials will be posted online on our <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/events">Events page</a> on the GATK website, so be sure to check them out if you can't be here in person.</p>
