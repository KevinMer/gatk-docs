## Poster Teaser: The Features of GATK 3.0

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>Alright, the next release is going to be version 3.0. So what's in it??</p>

<p>We'll have a full overview ready for you in the next few days.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you're at AGBT-2014 working on your tan (lucky devil), one way to find out is to go see Mauricio Carneiro's poster during the Thursday afternoon poster session, and ask him all about it (you're welcome, MC -- we know you like the attention).</p>

<p>If you're not, here's a copy of Mauricio's poster, which features three of the top features in GATK 3.0. Because why should you miss out, on top of having to shovel snow all over again tomorrow (or whatever the applicable chore is in your neck of the woods) instead of drinking margaritas by the pool?</p>

He/she (we're not sure; we respect its privacy) builds a fresh copy of the GATK every night with the day's new developments that made it into the master branch.</em></p>
