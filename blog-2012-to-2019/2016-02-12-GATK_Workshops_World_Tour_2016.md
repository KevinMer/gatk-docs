## GATK Workshops World Tour 2016

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>For the last few years, we have taught GATK workshops at institutions in various countries around the world. It started out as a small-scale effort with one or two workshops a year in addition to the annual workshop hosted at the Broad itself, but it seems that word has gone around because our dance card is filling up faster every year. Here's a quick recap of where we stand for the 2016 season.</p>

<hr></hr><h3>The tour so far</h3>

<p>We kicked off this year's World Tour in style -- on the other side of the world! In two back-to-back 2-day workshops in Sydney and Melbourne, our 3-person workshop crew walked a diverse assortment of researchers and bioinformaticians through the essentials of GATK Best Practices for Variant Discovery, in theory on Day 1 and in practice on Day 2. Lots of great questions were asked, most were answered, and a lot of coffee was consumed. Our thanks to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bioplatforms.com/">Bioplatforms Australia</a> for setting up these workshops at UNSW in Sydney and at the University of Melbourne, and taking great care of us (so much good coffee!). We look forward to hearing from our Aussie users on the forum.</p>

<hr></hr><h3>What if you can't attend?</h3>

<p>If you can't make it to one of our workshops in person, check out the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/presentations">Presentations</a> section of the documentation guide. There you can watch the workshop videos from the BroadE workshops, as well as download the workshop slides and tutorial materials from all workshops that we have taught so far. Some of the most recent haven't been posted yet but we'll get that done soon. In the meantime if you're in a hurry you can find those materials in previous posts; look for the "workshops" or "presentations" tags.</p>
