## Beer's on Birney

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>This Thursday, the team enjoyed an array of Belgian beers <a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/ewanbirney/status/263430030548406272">generously offered by Ewan Birney</a> as reward for integration of CRAM support into GATK (version 3.5 and up). We feel the Birn!</p>

<p>Our thanks also to the Samtools team who <a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/ewanbirney/status/573125054239805440">led the way</a>, Vadim Zalunin from EBI who contributed the lion's share of the code toward this effort, and various people besides who helped make this happen.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
