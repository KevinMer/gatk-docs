## XHMM support is no longer available here

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>The XHMM (eXome-Hidden Markov Model) C++ software suite calls copy number variation (CNV) from targeted capture sequencing data. Until now we hosted XHMM support in our forum, but as of today XHMM is now exclusively supported on the XHMM website.</p>

<p>For XHMM support, please go to <a href="http://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/xhmm/questions.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/xhmm/questions.shtml</a></p>
