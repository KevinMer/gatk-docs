## 2015 Nov BroadE workshop hands-on tutorial materials

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>We are scheduled to do 2 hands-on modules at the BroadE GATK workshop at the Broad Institute this Thursday, Nov. 19.</p>

<p>The tutorial materials for each module include the following:</p>

<ul><li>Workshop dataset and an appendix document containing detailed instructions for preparing for the workshop</li>
<li>Tutorial worksheet containing the actual exercises done in the workshop</li>
</ul><p>Attendees will receive a printout of the worksheets for the module to which they have registered. We will not provide printouts of the appendix documents.</p>

<p>If you are registered to attend, you must have downloaded the materials and followed the instructions before the workshop starts, otherwise you will not be able to follow along and your workshop experience will be unsatisfying. We certainly don't want that to happen, so be sure to do your homework as follows below the fold. Be sure to identify correctly which workshop you are registered for!</p>

<hr></hr><h3>Variant Discovery (morning session)</h3>

<h4>Get the dataset + appendix bundle: 5 minutes</h4>

<p>Note that the file and directory names make reference to ASHG 2015 because these materials were originally developed for the GATK workshop we taught at the ASHG 2015 meeting. There, that's one mystery cleared up!</p>

<ul><li>Download the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwTg3aXzGxEDc0c0UGtUcS1maDQ/view?usp=sharing">52 Mb zip file</a> to the laptop you will bring to the workshop, and save it where you want the tutorial files to sit.</li>
<li>Open the zip file; this will create a directory called <code class="code codeInline" spellcheck="false">ASGH15_GATK</code>.</li>
<li>Open the <code class="code codeInline" spellcheck="false">ASGH15_GATK</code> directory, look at the contents and read the extremely brief README.txt file.</li>
</ul><h4>Refresh your memory of the topic and scientific context of the workshop: 10-20 minutes</h4>

<ul><li>Open the PDF document called ASGH15_GATK-Appendix.</li>
<li>Read the introduction. If any of the content is especially new or confusing to you, consider following the links included to the additional documentation on our website. We will cover this content briefly at the start of the tutorial, but the more you prepare, the better your workshop experience will be.</li>
</ul><h4>Install and test software: 30-45 minutes</h4>

<p>Go over the second part of the ASGH15_GATK-Appendix document to acquaint yourself with the technical requirements of the workshop and follow the detailed installation instructions. In particular:</p>

<ul><li>Make sure you have the correct version of Java installed (Java 7 / JRE 1.7).</li>
<li>Download all 3 software packages (GATK, Samtools, IGV) to the laptop you will bring to the workshop.</li>
<li>Copy the program files of all three to the <code class="code codeInline" spellcheck="false">ASGH15_GATK</code> directory.</li>
<li>Run the test commands for GATK and Samtools, and launch IGV.</li>
</ul><p>If you are new to the command line or GATK, we strongly recommend reviewing the sections of the document about tool syntax (pages 8-10) and practicing basic Unix commands. You may also benefit from spending some time gaining familiarity with IGV.</p>

<hr></hr><h3>Callset Filtering &amp; Evaluation (afternoon session)</h3>

<p>The appendix file is now available from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwTg3aXzGxEDckQyVUNvNE9BYU0/view?usp=sharing">this link</a>. The data bundle is available <a rel="nofollow" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwTg3aXzGxEDeTVBNEUzUE9OS1U/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
