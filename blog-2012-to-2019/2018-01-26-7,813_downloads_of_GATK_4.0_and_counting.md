## 7,813 downloads of GATK 4.0 and counting

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>Over the past two weeks and a bit, the GATK 4.0(.0.0) package has been downloaded nearly eight thousand times. That's... not too shabby! Let's see if y'all can take it to 8,000 before we cut the 4.0.1.0 release <img class="emoji" src="https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)" alt=":)" height="20"></img></p>

<p><em>Yes, I plan to explain the version numbering system in an upcoming blog post.</em></p>

<p>Looking back at our download records, it outdoes any previous release we've ever done by a factor of nearly four. Interestingly, it comes after a major slump in download numbers over the past six months, <em>a.k.a.</em> since we announced the GATK4 beta and the open-sourcing at the Bio-IT World meeting in May 2017. It looks like a lot of people were holding their breath waiting for the 4.0 release... I hope it was worth the wait.</p>

<hr></hr><p>In case you're curious, the download stats for GATK 4.x versions come from Github and are conveniently available <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.somsubhra.com/github-release-stats/?username=broadinstitute&amp;repository=gatk">here</a>. You can see that the count has increased since I looked it up earlier this evening!</p>

<p>Download stats for older versions come from the GATK website (because we used to host the package ourselves) and are not directly accessible publicly.</p>
