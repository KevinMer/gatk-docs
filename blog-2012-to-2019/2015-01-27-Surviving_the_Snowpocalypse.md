## Surviving the Snowpocalypse

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>So you may have heard the US Northeast is getting a little bit of snow. Here's what it looked like this morning at GATK Support HQ, during a relative lull that allowed me to do a first round of clearing:</p>

<p>Not too bad so far, but it looks like it's going to get worse before it gets better. Round two is going to suck.</p>

<p>Anyway, the Broad is shut down for the duration of the state of emergency, and we are all at home waiting out the snowpocalypse. The GATK forum will be mostly unattended while we hunker down and sip hot cocoa with marshmallows. Assuming the power stays on and we're able to dig ourselves out of the snow when it's all over, normal service should resume by end of day Wednesday.</p>
