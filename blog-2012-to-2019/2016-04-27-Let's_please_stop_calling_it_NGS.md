## Let's please stop calling it NGS

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>Can we all agree that this is 2016 and <em>next-generation sequencing</em> is really just <em>sequencing</em> at this point?</p>

<p>Seriously, I was in college when NGS was becoming a thing. In techno-geological terms, that was the Cretaceous. Yet over a decade later, this super-vague term is somehow still stuck in our collective consciousness.</p>

<p>I'm not the one to say what is the <em>real</em> next generation of sequencing, maybe Nanopore and all that exotic long-read tech. My point is that calling the current generation of sequencing technology <em>next-gen</em> or <em>NGS</em> is embarrassingly retrograde and we should all stop*.</p>

<p><small>*I'm sure we have some old articles in our docs that use the term NGS, if you point them out to me I'll fix them.</small></p>

<p>Of course, there's still Sanger sequencing and we want to be able to tell the difference -- but really, isn't it Sanger that is the oddball now, and the rest is just <em>regular</em> sequencing? Well, if we must -- hey look we have a technically-accurate term, it's called <strong>high-throughput sequencing</strong>. It even comes with a reasonably snappy three-letter abbreviation to slap in titles and on posters where space is at a premium: <strong>HTS</strong> (putting the <em>hts</em> in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/samtools/htsjdk">htsjdk</a>).</p>

<p>Alright, rant over. Until next time.</p>
