## Announcing details of the commercial licensing for GATK 2

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>As announced a few months ago, commercial users of the GATK will now be required to purchase a license in order to use the full-version GATK 2 for commercial / for-profit use (while GATK-Lite can still be used for any purpose without a license).</p>

<p>We are now able to give you more details about how this will work: we have selected a company called <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.appistry.com/">Appistry</a> to be the exclusive partner who will handle <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.appistry.com/gatk">for-profit GATK licensing and support</a>. If you have any questions, please visit their <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.appistry.com/gatk/gatk-faqs-static">FAQs page</a>, and contact them directly to inquire about pricing or any "special case" scenario you feel may apply to your use of the GATK.</p>

<p>Appistry will launch a discussion forum within the next few days in which you will be able to network with your peers and Appistry staff about the for-profit release of the GATK.</p>

<p>If you would like to discuss why we have made these changes to the licensing model, please see our own discussion thread on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/discussion/1261/discussion-of-the-new-licensing-and-mixed-open-source-model">licensing and source code models in GATK 2</a>.</p>
