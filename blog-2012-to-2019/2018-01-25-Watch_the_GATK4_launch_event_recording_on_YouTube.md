## Watch the GATK4 launch event recording on YouTube

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>Two weeks ago, for the official release of GATK version 4.0, we held a live online event that was both a launch party and a comprehensive if condensed overview of everything that's new in GATK4. Over the course of two hours, members of the GATK development team and a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/blog?id=11131">great lineup of external guests</a> gave presentations about the new capabilities, discussed their implications in small panels and answered questions from the online audience.</p>

<p>I had the privilege of serving as host -- and unintentional comic relief, between forgetting panelists and bumping into the set furniture -- so I'm probably biased, but I'd say it was the most fun-yet-informative event we've done so far on GATK. Not that we do a lot of events -- and it's mostly just workshops -- but this felt pretty special. We had a great time doing it, and lots of people showed up to watch and ask questions. So we're now considering doing others in a similar vein, though they would each be focused on a specific topic and have more time for answering questions from the online audience. If that sounds like something you'd be interested in, let us know in the comments!</p>

<p>Anyway, the recording of the full event is now available <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZj--Y3oUQc&amp;list=PLbhQIHW7hn4ioePCrbc8QEhzyGUTjzinv">on YouTube</a>, and you can always find it again on our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZj--Y3oUQc&amp;list=PLbhQIHW7hn4ioePCrbc8QEhzyGUTjzinv">Presentations page</a>.</p>
