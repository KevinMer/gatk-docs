## New User Story -- Securing a genetic diagnosis for two children with central hypothyroidism

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>We are pleased to announce that a new User Story has been published on the GATK website. This brief article tells the story of researchers from Boston Children's Hospital who were able to secure a genetic diagnosis for two kids with central hypothyroidism thanks to the GATK Best Practices, where a previous analysis had failed. The story illustrates the real-world importance of using the right processing steps and parameters to get usable results out of your data.</p>
