## Introducing the GATK blog

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>We're happy to announce that we are finally joining the rest of the civilized world in the twenty-first century, and starting a blog.</p>

<p>It's not just because we needed a place to post cute cat pictures (though that's bound to happen). The thing is, we've come to realize that we don't communicate enough about what we're working on in terms of new features and tool improvements in GATK. Time and again we've heard from users on the forum who are hesitant to upgrade to a newer version because changing versions imposes a lot of overhead in terms of adapting analyses, maintaining scripts and so on. What if a really key feature comes out next month? How do you know when you should upgrade, or wait for the next one? In a perfect world you'd upgrade every time, but we know that's just not possible for a lot of folks. We'd like to help by giving you more visibility into what's in the pipe. And it would be useful to get some feedback about the ideas we're working on as we go, rather than after a version release.</p>

<p>So this is our blog: <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/blog" rel="nofollow">http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/blog</a></p>

<p>The interface may still change a little (it's kind of pale right now, overall) but ultimately the idea is to keep it as a no-frills, content-first channel for letting you know what we're thinking about and what we've got in store for the GATK -- starting tomorrow with a sneak preview of the next release!</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and you can follow us on Twitter <a href="https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/profile/gatk_dev" rel="nofollow">@gatk_dev</a> if you're into that sort of thing. All the cool kids are doing it.</p>
