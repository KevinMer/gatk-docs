## ASHG 2016 in Vancouver - Terrible weather, exciting science!

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>The weather in Vancouver is awful right now, and that's probably a good thing -- it should keep the outdoorsy types like myself from succumbing to the natural beauty of British Columbia and skipping out on any of the great science lined up for us this week. And rumor is the WIFI is pretty decent!</p>

<p>I sure hope it is, because this afternoon in the GATK workshop we're going to be running some live demos of how to run GATK analyses on the Cloud. We have screencap videos as backup in case technology abandons us, but it's just not the same to play a recording... (for one thing, the recording is probably more reliable than my brain, but shush).</p>

<p>We'll also have a hands-on tutorial on somatic exome CNV analysis with GATK4, and the overall workshop will be peppered with live polls, in an effort to make the experience as interactive and engaging as possible. This is something the ASHG workshop organizers have been pushing for over the past few meetings, and rightly so.</p>

<p>It's a tall order with a crowd of 225 registered users (we get a ballroom!) but we've got a solid 90 minutes lined up to talk about all brand new GATK content. This is going to be fun!</p>

<p>Oh, and the slides and tutorial worksheet are <a rel="nofollow" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwTg3aXzGxEDaWF4YndnTTVWNFE?usp=sharing">here</a>, to complement the tutorial bundle which is available from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/download/workshops">Download</a> page.</p>
