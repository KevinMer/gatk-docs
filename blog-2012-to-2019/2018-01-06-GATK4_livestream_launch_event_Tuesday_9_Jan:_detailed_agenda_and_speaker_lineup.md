## GATK4 livestream launch event Tuesday 9 Jan: detailed agenda and speaker lineup

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>In just a few days, we'll be releasing GATK4 into general availability -- that's right, the big 4.0! To mark the occasion we are hosting a launch event that will be livestreamed on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.facebook.com/broadinstitute">Broad Institute's Facebook</a>. Here's a short URL if you'd like to share it: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://broad.io/facebook">broad.io/facebook</a>.</p>

<p>The launch event is going to be a two-hour whistle-stop tour of what's new and shiny in GATK4. My fellow members of the Data Sciences Platform and GATK development team will give short presentations on key features, then we'll have some panel discussions to dig a bit deeper into the technical underpinnings and implications of these features. For the panels we'll be joined by a really exciting lineup of special guests from the University of California Santa Cruz, Yale School of Medicine, Intel, IBM Research, Verily Life Sciences, Amazon Web Services, Cloudera, Alibaba Cloud, and Microsoft Genomics. Details below the fold.</p>

<p>We should also have some time to take questions from the online audience, so be sure to log in and ask your questions in the comments section of the livestream. We'll also be checking the forums and Twitter for those of you who don't have a Facebook account. To be clear, you don't need an account to watch the video stream.</p>

<p>We hope you'll join us to celebrate this important milestone!</p>
