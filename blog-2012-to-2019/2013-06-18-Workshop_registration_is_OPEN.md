<p>BroadE Workshop: Best Practices for Variant Calling with the GATK<br>
Tuesday, July 9 &amp; Wednesday, July 10, 2013<br>
9:00 AM - 12:00 PM</p>

<p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cvent.com/d/kcq5ww/4W">REGISTER HERE</a></p>

<p>This workshop will focus on the core steps involved in calling variants with the Broad’s Genome Analysis Toolkit, using the “Best Practices” developed by the GATK team. You will learn why each step is essential to the calling process, what are the key operations performed on the data at each step, and how to use the GATK tools to get the most accurate and reliable results out of your dataset.</p>

<p>The workshop will last two days, divided into lecture-style sessions in the morning and optional hands-on sessions in the afternoon (note that for practical reasons, attendance at the latter will be limited). In the morning, you’ll hear from the GATK development team and invited guests, who will explain the rationale, theory and real-life applications of the Best Practices. In the afternoon, the GATK team will help you work through interactive exercises and tutorials in which you will apply the Best Practices to real datasets.</p>

<p>Optional: Hands-on tutorial sessions &amp; Breakout session on XHMM and GenomeSTRiP</p>
