## Special webinar on GATK 3 features (4/10)

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>Our partners at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://appistry.com/">Appistry</a> are putting on another webinar next week, and this one's going to be pretty special in our view -- because we're going to be doing pretty much all the talking!</p>

<p>Titled <a rel="nofollow" href="http://appistry.com/news-and-events/speed-cohorts-and-rnaseq-insider-look-gatk-3">"Speed, Cohorts, and RNAseq: An Insider Look into GATK 3"</a> (see that link for the full program), this webinar will be all about the GATK 3 features, of course. And lest you think this is just another marketing pitch (no offense, marketing people), rest assured that we will be diving into the gory technical details of what happens under the hood. This is a great opportunity to get the inside scoop on how the new features (RNAseq, GVCF pipeline etc) work -- all the stuff that's fit to print, but that we haven't had time to write down in the docs yet. So don't miss it if that's the sort of thing that floats your boat! Or if you miss it, be sure to check out the recording afterward.</p>

<p>As usual the webinar is completely free and open to everyone (not just Appistry customers or prospective for-profit users). All you need to do is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/570723633">register now</a> and tune in on Thursday 4/10.</p>

<p>Talk to you then!</p>
