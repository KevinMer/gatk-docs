That's a lot of flying but on the bright side, now I have Gold status on American Airlines (hello fast track lane).</p>

<p>So after a restful summer hiatus we're gearing up to revisit continental Europe -- specifically, we're heading to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Basel,+Switzerland/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x479049c72769304f:0x361ceb70f36d8a90?sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiolaHu9LnOAhWIDMAKHf47AFIQ8gEIgAEwDg">Basel, Switzerland</a>, at the invitation of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics.</p>

<p>We'll be following our standard formula of one day of lectures focused on the Best Practices for variant discovery, and one day of optional hands-on practical sessions demonstrating key steps of analysis and interpretation. The registration page is now live at this link: <a href="http://www.sib.swiss/training/upcoming-training-events/training/gatk-workshop-lecture" rel="nofollow">http://www.sib.swiss/training/upcoming-training-events/training/gatk-workshop-lecture</a></p>

<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://us.v-cdn.net/5019796/uploads/FileUpload/b8/4a881e0c0c8c3b9bf9741c868e6d5d.jpg"><img src="https://us.v-cdn.net/5019796/uploads/FileUpload/80/76ba07495ffefdf7657d58ad059139.jpg" width="200px" border="none" alt="image" style="float: left;" class="embedImage-img importedEmbed-img"></img></a> One important note: we'll be offering the day of hands-on practicals twice (in order to serve more people), which is why the workshop dates span three days -- but to be clear each person will only attend two days out of the three (the lectures are on Day 1 for everyone). The practical sessions have limited space, and tend to fill up fast, so don't wait too long to register -- especially if you have a strong preference about which of the two optional days would work better for you.</p>

<p>If you can't make it to Basel, the next workshops will be at Broad in Boston/Cambridge (USA) on November 7-8, then at VIB in Leuven (Belgium), dates TBD (probably February). Details will follow in due time.</p>

<p>We look forward to seeing many of you in Basel!</p>
