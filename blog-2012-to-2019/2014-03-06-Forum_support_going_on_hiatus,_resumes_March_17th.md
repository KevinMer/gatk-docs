## Forum support going on hiatus, resumes March 17th

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>With my impeccable sense of timing, I am leaving for a 10-day vacation on the day we release the big new version.</p>

<p>To be blunt (because I am in a hurry to catch a plane): there will be no one assigned to answer forum questions. Other GATK team members may find it in their hearts to answer questions, but they have busy schedules, so don't count on it.</p>

<p>My apologies for the inconvenience! I will be back at my post on the 17th.</p>

<p>In the meantime, please enjoy the new release. I hope the new docs I posted today help you make sense of the new features. You can also have a look at the slide decks we presented this week at Mahidol University in Bangkok, Thailand; they contain more background on the new features (world premiere on the road, whoo) and are available in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/z8t48ncoxv9z24d/s1Ew1_5REq">GSA Dropbox</a>.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
