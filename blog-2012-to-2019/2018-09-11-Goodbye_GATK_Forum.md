## Goodbye GATK Forum

By Sheila

<p>Dear GATK users,</p>

<p>I am writing this blog post to let you know it has been a wonderful 4+ years working on the forum and answering your questions. Thank you all for giving me a job for all this time and keeping me entertained <img class="emoji" src="https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)" alt=":)" height="20"></img> I enjoyed learning all about the GATK while answering your questions. But the time has come for me to move on and learn some new skills.</p>

<p>I am not leaving the forum unattended, however. We have a new team member joining, along with a few other people who will be able to help you all out. There will be another blog post soon to introduce the new team members.</p>

<p>I trust these new team members will do a great job, and I wish you all the best in your journeys.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
Sheila</p>
