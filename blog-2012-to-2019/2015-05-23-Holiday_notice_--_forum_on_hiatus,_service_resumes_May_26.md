## Holiday notice -- forum on hiatus, service resumes May 26

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>As the USA will be observing Memorial Day on Monday 25, forum support will be (mostly) unavailable until Tuesday 26.</p>

<p>I say mostly because some of us have been known to sneak away from friends and family to secretly answer forum questions on their smartphone. Which is terrible social etiquette and must be strictly discouraged, of course.</p>

<p>To anyone in the USA and abroad who will be enjoying a long weekend, have a great time, and do spare a thought for the men and women whose service and sacrifices we honor on this occasion.</p>

<p>To the rest of y'all, sorry folks! But I'm sure you have holidays we don't have <img class="emoji" src="https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)" alt=":)" height="20"></img></p>
