## Happy New Year 2015 and welcome back to the GATK forum

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>It's a shiny New Year and the forum, like the rest of Broad, is back to active status, so bring it on! It might take us a day or two to mop up the questions that came in during the break so we appreciate your patience as always (although thanks to superuser <a href="https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/profile/pdexheimer" rel="nofollow">@pdexheimer</a> there's a bunch that are already resolved, yay).</p>

<p>In the next few days we'll hopefully have some hot new announcements for you, so please keep on eye on this space.</p>
