## MPG Primer on sequencing and variant discovery pipelines

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>Geraldine Van der Auwera presented this talk as part of the Broad Institute's Medical and Population Genetics (MPG) Primers series.</p>

<p>This talk provides a high-level overview of the workflow for performing variant discovery on high-throughput sequencing data, as described in the GATK Best Practices and implemented in the Broad's production pipelines.</p>

<p>The following points emphasized in this presentation are:</p>

<ul><li>Informational content of data file formats and flow of information throughout the pipeline</li>
<li>Concepts involved in the data transformations (processing steps and analysis methods)</li>
<li>Motivation and key mechanics of the GVCF workflow for scalable joint variant discovery</li>
<li>Relation of the GATK Best Practices to the Broad's production pipeline implementation</li>
</ul><p>The presentation slide deck is available at this <a rel="nofollow" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwTg3aXzGxEDYzJpbWdMbEloN0U">link</a>.</p>
