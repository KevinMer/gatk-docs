## GATK, WDL, Cromwell and Terra at ASHG 2019

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>If it's hot, humid and everyone around you has a name tag, you're probably in Houston, TX for ASHG. I know there's a lot going on and a million different presentations vying for your attention, so I'll cut to the chase: we have several members of our department (Data Sciences Platform) who will be at the Broad Genomics booth #714 in the Exhibition Hall at the following times. Don't miss this opportunity to come chat with us in person and get answers for all your burning questions about the latest exciting developments, whether it's <a rel="nofollow" href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/blog?id=24466">DRAGEN-GATK</a> or <a rel="nofollow" href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/wdl/blog?id=24512">Cromwell on Azure</a> that floats your boat, or you just want to learn more about running our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/cloud">fully configured GATK pipelines on Terra</a>. We look forward to seeing you there!</p>
