## Appistry Pipeline Contest

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>Creative minds, your attention please -- our licensing partners, Appistry, are holding a competition! From the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.appistry.com/contest/">Appistry Pipeline Challenge webpage</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="UserQuote blockquote"><div class="blockquote-content">
  <p class="blockquote-line">The Appistry Pipeline Challenge will reward and support one winning proposal for a creative pipeline that will make a difference in clinical research and precision medicine. We’ll provide the winner with a complete NGS analysis package valued at $70,000 including commercial-grade bioinformatics tools for variant calling and somatic mutation analysis, software and hardware for developing and executing pipelines at scale, and a year’s worth of support so that you can make your idea a reality.</p>
</div></blockquote>

<p>There's more detailed information on the contest webpage of course, and if that doesn't answer all your questions, Appistry is holding a live webinar tomorrow (Thursday 7/24) to give additional details and answer questions.</p>

<p>The deadline for submissions is August 15th, so if you have an idea, better get on it!</p>
