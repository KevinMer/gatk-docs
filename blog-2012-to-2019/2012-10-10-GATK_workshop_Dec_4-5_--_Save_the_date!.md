## GATK workshop Dec 4-5 -- Save the date!

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>We are organizing a two-day GATK workshop to be held at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, MA on Dec 4-5 2012.</p>

<p>This workshop will focus on the core steps involved in calling variants with the Broad’s Genome Analysis Toolkit, using the “Best Practices” developed by the GATK team. You will learn why each step is essential to the calling process, what are the key operations performed on the data at each step, and how to use the GATK tools to get the most accurate and reliable results out of your dataset.</p>

<p>The workshop will last two days, divided into lecture-style sessions in the morning and optional hands-on sessions in the afternoon (note that for practical reasons, attendance at the latter will be limited, so be sure to sign up early). In the morning, you’ll hear from the GATK development team, who will explain the rationale, theory and real-life applications of the Best Practices. In the afternoon, the GATK team will help you work through interactive exercises and tutorials in which you will apply the Best Practices to real datasets.</p>

<p>Registration is not yet open; we will post another announcement when it is, but be sure to save the date if you are interested in attending.</p>

<p>Please note that this workshop is primarily intended for Cambridge and Boston-area users; users from further afield are welcome to come, but at this time we regretfully cannot offer any financial assistance for travel or lodging. Rest assured that we will make videos of the talks and all teaching materials available online following the workshop.</p>
