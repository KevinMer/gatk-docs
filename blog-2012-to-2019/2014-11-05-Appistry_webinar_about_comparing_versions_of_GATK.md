## Appistry webinar about comparing versions of GATK

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>Our partners at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.appistry.com/genomics-research-tools/genome-analysis-toolkit/">Appistry</a> are doing another <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.appistry.com/event/live-webinar-comparing-gatks/">free live webinar</a> tomorrow (Nov 7), this time focusing on the differences between versions of GATK. The ultimate point is, of course, to convince any stragglers to upgrade to the latest and greatest major version series (GATK 3.x for those of you following at home) but unlike us, they will actually take the time to explain in detail why this is a winning proposition.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about the differences between versions, be sure to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.appistry.com/event/live-webinar-comparing-gatks/">register</a> today and tune in tomorrow, Thursday 7 November at 12 pm EDT. Anyone can join (not just Appistry customers) so don't miss this great learning opportunity. Every question will be answered, either during the live event or by email afterward if they run out of time.</p>
