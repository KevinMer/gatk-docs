By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>Do you ever get frustrated by the current state of the GATK documentation? Do you find it hard to find information about what tools you should use and how they work? And when you do find relevant documentation, do you ever find it unclear and difficult to understand?</p>

<p>Yeah, so do we. The amount of new tools and algorithms has exploded in recent years, and despite our best efforts, it can be tough for us to keep our educational materials clear and up to date. So we're preparing to make a big push to address these problems.</p>

<h2>First order of business: we're hiring!</h2>

<p>Specifically, we have a science writer position open in our User Education team: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://lnkd.in/eHWiQF3">https://lnkd.in/eHWiQF3</a></p>
