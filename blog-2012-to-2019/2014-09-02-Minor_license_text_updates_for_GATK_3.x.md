## Minor license text updates for GATK 3.x

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>We've made a few minor updates to the license text as follows:</p>

<ul><li>Updated the major version number from GATK2 to GATK3;</li>
<li>Updated the Broad address from 7 Cambridge Center to 415 Main Street (simple renaming, no move involved);</li>
<li>Added an explicit mention of the Phone Home reporting feature (which you can read more about <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/article?id=1250">here</a>);</li>
<li>Clarified the terms relative to third-party contributions to protected code (section 2.1 - Grant).</li>
</ul><p>None of these changes should have any effect on anyone's ability to use GATK.</p>
