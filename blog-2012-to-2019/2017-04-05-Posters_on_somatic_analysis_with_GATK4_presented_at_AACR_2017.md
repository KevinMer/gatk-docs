<p>A few of us GATKers (among a flood of other Broadies) traveled to Washington, DC this week for the General Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR). Here are PDF copies of the posters we presented on Tuesday morning.</p>

I was hoping to catch an earlier flight on standby; the gate attendant laughed so hard. Most of the flights are overbooked to start with. So I have some time to kill until 9 PM. Well, I guess there's plenty of documentation in need of writing!</p>
