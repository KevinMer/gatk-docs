## Job opportunity for a computational biologist

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>Do you dream of working on challenging problems, in a stimulating environment with plentiful resources? Or do you simply love the GATK and wish you could spend every waking moment playing with it?</p>

<p>Good news! We have a position open for a computational biologist to join our team. You can find out more about us on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/about/who-we-are">this page</a>, and a detailed job description on the Broad's recruiting webpage <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/careers/job-openings/job-openings-0">here</a> (search for job requisition #1107).</p>

<p>If you're interested (and who wouldn't be?) please apply directly on the jobs webpage. The Broad's lovely HR people will handle your application and answer any questions you may have about the hiring process and employment conditions.</p>

<p>We are of course happy to answer questions here in this thread about what it's like to work in the GSA group (awesome!) and how interesting it is to work on the bleeding edge of genome research (amazing!). Feel free to private-message us about it if you don't want your supervisor to know that you're thinking of jumping ship ;-)</p>
