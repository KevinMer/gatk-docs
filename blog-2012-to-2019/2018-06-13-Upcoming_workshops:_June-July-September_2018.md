## Upcoming workshops: June-July-September 2018

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>We've had a very active workshop season so far, and just because it's almost summer doesn't mean we're slowing down. Later this month we'll be at the <strong>GCC/BOSC conference in Portland, OR</strong>, teaching a 2.5 hr <a rel="nofollow" href="https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/event/DnB1/gatk4-whats-new-and-how-to-run-it">GATK4 workshop</a>, as well as assisting colleagues who are teaching a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/event/DnAs/wdl-the-workflow-description-language">WDL pipelining workshop</a>. There's still some space open so register now if you'd like to join us!</p>

<p>In July we'll be in <strong>Cambridge, UK</strong> to teach our now-classic 4-day workshop; it's fully booked at this point but there's a waitlist you can add yourself to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://training.csx.cam.ac.uk/bioinformatics/event/2483603">here</a>. Even if you don't get in, it tells us how many people would have liked to attend but couldn't, and that helps us determine how many more workshops we need to organize and where.</p>

<p>In September we'll be teaching the same 4-day workshop formula in <strong>Seville, Spain</strong>, augmented with a 5th day on variant interpretation taught by the host institution. Registration for this workshop just opened <a rel="nofollow" href="http://courseswiki.clinbioinfosspa.es/gatk2018/start">here</a>.</p>

<p>As always, there will be more -- and if you're interested in hosting us at your institution, just let me know in the comments or over private message.</p>
