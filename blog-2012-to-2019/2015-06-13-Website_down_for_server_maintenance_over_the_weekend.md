## Website down for server maintenance over the weekend

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>The GATK website will be down at some point over the weekend between Saturday and Sunday night due to maintenance operations on the Broad servers. We don't know exactly what will be the time and the duration of the outage -- hopefully it will be brief.</p>

<p>The forum itself (including the documentation articles) will remain available, although the styling and layout may be affected.</p>

<p>Apologies for the late notice.</p>

<p>Have a great weekend and we'll see you on the other side.</p>
