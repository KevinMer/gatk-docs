## Get it straight from the horse's mouth

By Geraldine_VdAuwera

<p>If you're at AGBT 2014 and you have any questions about the upcoming GATK 3.0 release, be sure to find Mauricio Carneiro (<a href="https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/profile/mauricinho" rel="nofollow">@mauricinho</a> on Twitter) and ask him all about it.</p>

<p>To make it easy (we hear it's a pretty big crowd) Mauricio will be in the BioTeam Suite # 186 (which is sponsored by Intel) on Friday 15th from 3:30 to 4pm. He'll be there specifically to represent the GATK dev team and answer questions about GATK 3.0, so don't be shy!</p>

<p><em>Mauricio is easy to identify: a friendly-looking guy with a ponytail. See <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/about/who-we-are#Carneiro">his bio</a> on the dev team page or his <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/~carneiro">personal webpage</a> for photos and more details about his background (can you believe he used to play Starcraft and Quake professionally?).</em></p>
